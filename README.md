## Frogger

Frogger is an elm based implementation of the old standby Frogger game. To build it, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Elm, version 0.18 or greater.

You can build it with:

```bash
./build
```

This will generate a *target/elm.js* file. Once that's been generated, you can 
visit the *index.html* file, serving it with any web server, and play the game.
